	<tr><td>The <span class=product>Copyright</span> command line utility simplifies and standardizes the process of adding a copyright notice to source code files.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

When source code files are prepared for distribution it is common for comments
to be stripped and text to be minified. As a result, any legal notices regarding
ownership and licensing is removed. This tool can be used to add that
information back into the distributable file.

### Prerequisites and installation

The <span>Copyright</span> utility uses Node.js. Package installation is
done via NPM. These are the only two prerequisites.

To install the utility and make it available to your Bash shell, use this
command.

```bash
[user@host]# npm install -g copyright
```

### Usage

The software is invoked from the command line with:

```bash
[user@host]# copyright [copyright file] [destination file] 
```

The `destination file` is prepended with the contents of the `copyright file`. The
contents should be in *comment form*, using whatever syntax is appropriate to the
source code language of the destination. So `/* ... */` for CSS, or `// ... ` for
JavaScript, or `<!-- ... --`> for HTML, etc. Linefeeds in the copyright file are
retained as is.

For the most efficient use of resources, this utility should be invoked by a
build tool that is sensitive to file modification timestamps, so that it is
triggered for each file in a nested hierarchy only when a source file is
changed. (The Read Write Tools `prorenata` builder has this capability.)
